# hasura-quick-start
This is the N+1 getting started repo. I've taken the basics of getting started locally and added a schema with tables, migrations, and the next X steps.

## Install & Use

This is a very basic Hasura project. To use this complete the following steps.



## The Build

The steps I followed to build out this example starter includes:

1. Created the directory "hasura-quick-start".
2. Installed the Hasura CLI.
3. Pulled the latest Docker Compose file.
4. Ran `hasura init` in the directory "hasura-quick-start" for the basic folder structure under `hasura`.
5. Launched `hasura console` for this instance and added the database connection for `PG_DATABASE_URL`.
6. Continued building out the database from the console so that migrations would be built.
7. Used the console to add some data, which added to the migrations.
8. Finished.
